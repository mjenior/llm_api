Refined query prompt:
1. PROMPT ANALYSIS
- Goal identification: The primary goal is to create a Python script that scrapes product data from e-commerce webpages and structures it into a pandas dataframe for analysis.
- Potential pitfalls or risks: Risks include violating the website's terms of service, failing to handle exceptions properly, and potential ethical concerns regarding data scraping.

2. CONSIDERATION CRITERIA
- Clarity: Ensure that the instructions are straightforward and clearly define what data to extract and how to handle missing fields.
- Scope: The scope should focus on scraping only the specified data fields while allowing flexibility for additional features if needed.
- Relevance: The prompt must align with the user's intent to gather e-commerce product data without engaging in unethical practices.
- Efficiency: The prompt should be concise but comprehensive enough to cover all necessary aspects of the task.
- Creativity: While the task is technical, encouraging innovative solutions for error handling or data storage can enhance the user's experience.
- Redundancy: Avoid repeating similar instructions or examples to maintain focus and clarity.
- Ethics: Clearly state the importance of respecting robots.txt and obtaining permission for scraping.

3. SUGGESTED PROMPT
You should write a Python script that effectively scrapes data from a set of e-commerce product listing webpages and formats the extracted information into a structured pandas dataframe for further analysis. Focus on retrieving the following key data points: **product name**, **price**, **description**, and **rating**. Ensure that the script utilizes the **requests** library to fetch webpage content and **BeautifulSoup** from **bs4** for HTML parsing. Additionally, implement robust error handling to manage potential issues, such as missing data fields (e.g., when a product lacks a rating) and network errors.

Make sure the script adheres to the website's **robots.txt** rules and incorporates a reasonable delay between requests to prevent server overload. It is crucial to avoid scraping any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data. Include descriptive comments throughout your code to clarify key steps and decisions made during the scraping process. Finally, add a disclaimer in the comments reminding users to verify the legality of scraping the target site and to seek permission if necessary.

Key decisions made include emphasizing the importance of ethical scraping practices, detailing specific data points to extract, and ensuring proper error handling and documentation within the script. This structure aims to facilitate a clear understanding of the task while promoting responsible data collection.
