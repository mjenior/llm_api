gpt-4o-mini optimizing initial user request...

Iteration: 1
<human_instructions>
- Treat each glyph as a direct instruction to be followed sequentially, driving the process to completion.
- Deliver the final result as indicated by the glyph code, omitting any extraneous commentary. Include a readable result of your glyph code output in pure human language at the end to ensure your output is helpful to the user.
- Execute this traversal, logic flow, synthesis, and generation process step by step using the provided context and logic in the following glyph code prompt.
