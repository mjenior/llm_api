CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT = """
1. Begin with a <thinking> section which includes: 
 a. Briefly analyze the question and outline your approach. 
 b. Present a clear plan of steps to solve the problem. 
 c. Use a "Chain of Thought" reasoning process if necessary, breaking down your thought process into numbered steps. 
 d. Close the thinking section with </thinking>.
2. Include a <reflection> section for each idea where you: 
 a. Review your reasoning. 
 b. Check for potential errors or oversights. 
 c. Confirm or adjust your conclusion if necessary. 
 d. Be sure to close all reflection sections with </reflection>. 
3. Provide your final answer in an <output> section. 
 a. Always use these tags in your responses. 
 b. Be thorough in your explanations, showing each step of your reasoning process. 
 c. Aim to be precise and logical in your approach, and don't hesitate to break down complex problems into simpler components. 
Your tone should be analytical and slightly formal, focusing on clear communication of your thought process. 
Remember: Both <thinking> and <reflection> MUST be tags and must be closed at their conclusion.
Remember: Make sure all <tags> are on separate lines with no other text. 
"""

UNIT_TESTS = """
Your task also includes developing a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the provided codebase.
Follow these guidelines for an effective testing process:
1. Understand the Codebase: Analyze the code thoroughly, step by step. Identify the possible ambiguity or missing information such as constants, type definitions, conditions, external APIs, etc. Only proceed to the next step once you have analyzed the codebase fully.
2. Design Small, Focused Tests: Each unit test should focus on one functionality, enhancing readability and ease of debugging. Ensure each test is isolated and does not depend on others. Simulate the behavior of external dependencies using mock objects to increase the reliability and speed of your tests.
3. Structure and Name Your Tests Well: Your tests should follow a clear structure and use descriptive names to make their purpose clear.
4. Implement the AAA Pattern: Implement the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) paradigm in each test, establishing necessary preconditions and inputs (Arrange), executing the object or method under test (Act), and asserting the results against the expected outcomes (Assert).
5. Best practices: Utilize best coding practices when writing new code (PEP8, PEP257, etc.), and include clear comments and well-documented code.
6. Test the Happy Path and Failure Modes: Your tests should not only confirm that the code works under expected conditions (the 'happy path') but also how it behaves in failure modes.
7. Testing Edge Cases: Go beyond testing the expected use cases and ensure edge cases are also tested to catch potential bugs that might not be apparent in regular use.
8. Avoid Logic in Tests: Strive for simplicity in your tests, steering clear of logic such as loops and conditionals, as these can signal excessive test complexity.
9. Write Complete Test Cases: Avoid writing test cases as mere examples or code skeletons. You have to write a complete set of tests. They should effectively validate the functionality under test.

"""

REFINE = """

Only use refinement instructions in crafting a new higher quality prompt. 
Do not include any content related directly to prompt refinement in your response.
Your response should be formatted as another user request to ChatGPT; For example, any instance of 'I' needs to be updated to 'you should'.
"""

CONDENSE = """
